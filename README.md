This project optimizes a Mean-Variance portfolio using stocks selected from team members' last name initials, spanning data from 2016 to 2021. Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance and Quandl, cleaned via ETL, and analyzed in R studio. The goal is to maximize returns while minimizing risks, comparing results with the SP500TR index.
