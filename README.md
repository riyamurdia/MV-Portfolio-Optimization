MV-Portfolio-Optimization
The aim of this project is to optimize a Mean-Variance (MV) portfolio using company tickers derived from the last names of group members. The data utilized for this optimization covers a period of five years, from 2016 to 2020, and will be evaluated during the initial three months of 2021. Alongside portfolio optimization, we will compute cumulative and annualized returns for the chosen stock tickers. This examination will offer valuable insights into portfolio performance, aiding in informed decision-making regarding investment strategy. Through consideration of individual stock performance and their interrelations, our objective is to construct a diversified portfolio that maximizes returns while mitigating risk. In summary, this project aims to deliver a thorough analysis of selected stocks and their potential to yield returns for investors.
